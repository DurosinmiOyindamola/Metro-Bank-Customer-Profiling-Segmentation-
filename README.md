# Metro-Bank-Customer-Profiling- And Segmentation
### Project Overview
As part of a data analytics community challenge, I analyzed Metro Bank’s customer profile and segmentation using Excel. The goal was to understand customer demographics, income distribution, loyalty, and segmentation to uncover actionable business insights.
### Problem Statement
The goal of this analysis is to understand Metro Bank’s customer base by profiling and segmenting customers according to demographics, income, and loyalty, in order to uncover insights that can guide targeted marketing campaigns.
### Key Insights
- The bank has a total of 500 customers, generating $57,199,411 in total income, with an average income of $144,399 per customer.
- The Retail segment is the largest, with 286 customers, while Private customers earn the highest average income at $118,774.
- Most customers have been with the bank for over 5 years, showing strong loyalty.
- The South region leads in customer numbers, with 70 female and 67 male customers.
- Gen X and Millennials make up the highest income brackets.
- The five most loyal customers are Edward Ramirez, Daniel Miller, Adam Montgomery, Abigail Gallegos, and Amanda Nelson.
### Recommendations
- Focus on Private customers, since they represent the high-income group and present strong opportunities for upselling.
- Consider launching loyalty programs for customers who’ve been with the bank 3–5 years to encourage retention and strengthen engagement.
- Use these insights to guide targeted marketing and personalized campaigns, making the most of both customer loyalty and income segmentation.
