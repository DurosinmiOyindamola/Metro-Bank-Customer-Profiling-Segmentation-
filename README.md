# Metro-Bank-Customer-Profiling- And Segmentation
### Project Overview
As part of a data analytics community challenge, I analyzed Metro Bank’s customer profile and segmentation using Excel. The goal was to understand customer demographics, income distribution, loyalty, and segmentation to uncover actionable business insights.
### Objectives
- Determine total customer count and distribution by Region and Gender.
- Segment customers by Age Group and Income Bracket.
- Identify the largest customer segment and the one with the highest average income.
- Analyze customer tenure and identify the most loyal customers.
### Process
1. Data Collection & Import
- Used the provided Customers.csv dataset.
- Imported the data into Excel for cleaning and analysis.
2. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and checked for missing or inconsistent values.
- Standardized column formats, especially dates and text fields.
3. Calculated Columns
- Created Age Groups (Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Boomers) using IF and IFS functions.
- Calculated Income Brackets (Low, Medium, High, Premium) with IF statements.
- Determined customer tenure using DATEDIF and TODAY() functions.
4. Data Summarization & Analysis
- Used PivotTables to summarize key metrics: customer count, segment sizes, income averages, loyalty, and regional distribution.
- Created Pivot Charts to visualize distributions by Age, Region, Gender, and Segment.
- Built interactive charts and dashboards to highlight trends and patterns clearly.
5. Dashboard Creation
Assembled the key charts and metrics into a one-page dashboard for a clear, concise overview.
### Key Insights
- The bank has a total of 500 customers, generating $57,199,411 in total income, with an average income of $144,399 per customer.
- The Retail segment is the largest, with 286 customers, while Private customers earn the highest average income at $118,774.
- Most customers have been with the bank for over 5 years, showing strong loyalty.
- The South region leads in customer numbers, with 70 female and 67 male customers.
- Gen X and Millennials make up the highest income brackets.
- The five most loyal customers are Edward Ramirez, Daniel Miller, Adam Montgomery, Abigail Gallegos, and Amanda Nelson.
### Recommendations
- Focus on Private customers, since they represent the high-income group and present strong opportunities for upselling.
- Consider launching loyalty programs for customers who’ve been with the bank 3–5 years to encourage retention and strengthen engagement.
- Use these insights to guide targeted marketing and personalized campaigns, making the most of both customer loyalty and income segmentation.
